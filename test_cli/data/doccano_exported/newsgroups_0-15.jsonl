It took just over two \nweeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) \nappologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered\nthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.\nHe wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must\nbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them\nwith!  \n\n\tAnyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  \nBeing nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first\ntime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected\n(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been\npissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!\n\tThe hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've\nheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get\nit swapped.\n\tI am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This\nwasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location\nof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for\nthese functions was much more convenient.\n\tOh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.\nI've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...\n\tAnyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!\n\ngnelson@physics.rutgers.edu", "meta": {"md5": "d779fdfb63d30af47fb4e78c34e9cf77", "pos_in_dataset": 1, "target": 4, "target_name": "comp.sys.mac.hardware"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

Can someone help me?\n\nUnfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into\nemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to\nchange the source code so that all of these special keys generated\ncharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier\nstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \"ESC [ 1 B 7\" \nwould indicate that the \"HOME\" key was pressed, with the shift key\ndown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\nas \"shift-Return\".\n\nIf anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\nin the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \nemacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods \nsomewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.\n\nNotes: \n\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \n   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.\n\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\n   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could \n   easily be adapted for anything else.\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+", "meta": {"md5": "aabc2f6503b820c5095eb7f269058b3d", "pos_in_dataset": 7, "target": 5, "target_name": "comp.windows.x"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

If I start your application with a -geometry option are\nyou going to ignore that as well?\n\nThere's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything\nif it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's\nno guarantee that you're going to get what you want.\n\n--\nTom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM", "meta": {"md5": "296b825314760bf9c6483ec4c35a8c4c", "pos_in_dataset": 14, "target": 5, "target_name": "comp.windows.x"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[3, 24, "sci.electronics"], [80, 103, "sci.electronics"], [163, 173, "talk.religion.misc"], [26, 52, "rec.sport.hockey"], [459, 477, "comp.windows.x"], [517, 536, "talk.religion.misc"], [392, 413, "alt.atheism"], [110, 128, "misc.forsale"], [367, 384, "talk.religion.misc"], [177, 206, "comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware"], [212, 242, "talk.politics.guns"], [316, 339, "talk.politics.misc"], [485, 510, "rec.sport.hockey"], [443, 455, "rec.sport.hockey"], [416, 441, "talk.politics.guns"], [344, 362, "talk.politics.mideast"], [293, 313, "comp.os.ms-windows.misc"], [249, 282, "soc.religion.christian"], [58, 72, "rec.sport.hockey"], [133, 159, "talk.politics.mideast"]]}
