Welcome to labelbuddy demo!
THIS IS A TEMPORARY DATABASE.

It will disappear when you close the application. This database contains a few documents and labels to allow trying out labelbuddy. You can create annotations, import more documents and labels and export annotations, but the database itself will be removed when labelbuddy exits.

(You don't have to actually read this text, try annotating it instead!)

If you decide to start a real project you want to keep, select "File > Open" and choose a location on your filesystem to create a persistent database.

Time to start annotating documents! Select some text with the mouse and click on one of the labels on the left to annotate it.

Once you have made annotations you can select any of them by clicking it or cycle through them with the Space key. The selected annotation becomes underlined and you can then change its label or remove it. Groups of overlapping annotations are shown in gray with white text. If you click such a group several times, each of the annotations it contains is selected in turn. (You can make the selected annotation bold by checking a box in the "Preferences" menu.)

Annotations are inserted in the database as you create them so there is no need for a "Save" button.

Once you are done annotating this document, you can click "Next" above to move on to another one.

The next document is the labelbuddy documentation, and then a few extracts from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to illustrate using labelbuddy with different languages and writing systems. The documentation in HTML format can be seen by clicking "Help > Documentation".

To see the list of documents, remove documents or labels, or change the labels' colors, go to the "Dataset" tab.

To export your annotations or import more documents or labels, go to the "Import / Export" tab.
